While this extension will work with any Easy Digital Download installation, we made it specifically to go alongside our [Crowdfunding](http://wordpress.org/plugins/appthemer-crowdfunding/) plugin, as it supports adding the collected data to our custom exports. We currently have two compatible themes that have been released:

* The first theme released is called ["Fundify"](http://themeforest.net/item/fundify-crowd-funding-wordpress-theme/4257622?ref=Astoundify) from [Astoundify](http://Astoundify.com/fundify.html) A large community crowdfunding theme, like Kickstarter or Indiegogo.
* The second theme released is called ["Campaignify"](http://themeforest.net/item/campaignify-multipurpose-crowdfunding-theme/4725411?ref=Astoundify) from [Astoundify](http://Astoundify.com/) A multi-purpose crowdfunding theme, great for single project crowdfunding.

== Installation ==
